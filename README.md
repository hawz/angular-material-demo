# Angular Material Demo

**This is exactly the same as the official [Angular Material-Start](https://github.com/angular/material-start) tutorial.**

Above is a snapshot of the Starter-App with a **Master-Detail** layout: showing a list of users
(left) and a user detail view (right).

Also shown is the user experience that will be displayed for smaller device sizes. The responsive
layout reveals the **menu** button that can be used to hide the user list and a **share** button
that can be used to show the Share bottom sheet view.

This Starter app demonstrates how:

*  Angular Material `layout` and `flex` options can easily configure HTML containers
*  Angular Material components `<md-toolbar>`, `<md-sidenav>`, `<md-icon>` can be quickly used
*  Custom controllers can use and show `<md-bottomsheet>` with HTML templates
*  Custom controller can easily, programmatically open & close the SideNav component.
*  Responsive breakpoints and `$mdMedia` are used
*  Theming can be altered/configured using `$mdThemingProvider`


This sample application is purposed as both a learning tool and a skeleton application for a typical
[AngularJS Material](http://material.angularjs.org/) web app: comprised of a Side navigation area
and a content area. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev
environment for these projects.
